![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajgopalv/Snake/master/ScreenShots/5.%20Twisted%20Gameplay.png)

First ever game written by me. This is a modified version of the C code written in 2005. This version was created to fit into the "Digital Diary" (an OOP project) project done in 2006. I do not have any copies of the original version (lost during a harddisk crash). All i am able to remember is the entire game was written in one big fat `main()` function.

### Software Requirements
- Windows XP or Lower.
- or, DOSBOX - download here:  http://www.dosbox.com/

## How to run.
The executables are in the `EXE` folder. 
Directly run the SNA.EXE if using windows XP or below.

For dosbox, 
Open DosBoX
```
\> mount C path/to/downloaded_snake/
\> c:
\> cd EXE
\> SNA.EXE
```

### For Dev
Was written using Turbo C++ 3.
Make sure you have graphics enabled and all the driver files in BGI folder.
