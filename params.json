This is a modified version of the C code written in 2005. This version was created to fit into the \"Digital Diary\" (an OOP project) project done in 2006. I do not have any copies of the original version (lost during a harddisk crash). All i am able to remember is the entire game was written in one big fat `main()` function.\r\n\r\n### Software Requirements\r\n- Windows XP or Lower.\r\n- or, DOSBOX - download here:  http://www.dosbox.com/\r\n\r\n## How to run.\r\nThe executables are in the `EXE` folder. \r\nDirectly run the SNA.EXE if using windows XP or below.\r\n\r\nFor dosbox, \r\nOpen DosBoX\r\n```\r\n\\> mount C path/to/downloaded_snake/\r\n\\> c:\r\n\\> cd EXE\r\n\\> SNA.EXE\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For Dev\r\nWas written using Turbo C++ 3.\r\nMake sure you have graphics enabled and all the driver files in BGI folder.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
